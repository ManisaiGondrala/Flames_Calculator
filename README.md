# Flames_Calculator

FLAMES is a popular childhood game that determines the nature of a relationship between two people based on their names. The game is often played for fun and amusement, with results ranging from "Friends" to "Marriage." This repository contains a Python implementation of the FLAMES game.

Game Rules
Players: The game is typically played by two participants, where each provides a name.
Preparation:
Each player inputs their name.
All spaces and duplicates between the two names are removed.
The total count of remaining characters is determined.
FLAMES Calculation:
Using the count, the letters F, L, A, M, E, S (standing for Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, and Siblings) are cycled through until only one letter remains.
Results:
The final letter of FLAMES gives the relationship result between the two names:
F stands for Friends.
L stands for Love.
A stands for Affection.
M stands for Marriage.
E stands for Enemy.
S stands for Siblings.
Usage
To run the FLAMES game, simply execute the Python script and follow the on-screen prompts to enter the two names. The script will then calculate and display the relationship result.
